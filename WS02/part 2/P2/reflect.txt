This workshop was quite complex a bit to figure out some concepts as we were using somethings that were kind of new
to me. Like chrono library, move operations, however after that I got some points that I mention:
Using move operations can increase the pace and efficiency. As unlike copy operations that do a deep copy of the object
and basically performing duplication, move operations can simply transfer the ownership of resources, like dynamically
allocated memory fromm one object to another. Obviously I got that this process is way more efficient and faster.
To refer, in my StringSet.cpp we can see how they actually perform and how simple they can do the job.
Regarding my approach in reading the input file in the constructor, I set to read the file twice actually. first to count the
words and then to populate the dynamic array with these words.
Honestly I did not have much time to think about this part of the question but definitely I think there must be ways for that.
About the last question, as mentioned earlier we were supposed to work with chrono library in this workshop that allows us
to have actual time measurement. Regarding the difference between steady_clock and system_clock, it is obvious that
the first one is the one that does not go backwards and cannot be affected by changes in system time.
Unlike this, sys_clock can be adjusted. But generally I can say we use steady_clock to measure time intervals, and
we use system_clock for getting the current time.
